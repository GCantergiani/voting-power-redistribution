## Abstract
_In Chile, since the restitution of democracy (1989), the distribution of parliamentary seats is governed by a binomial system, the only one of its kind in the world. In this electoral system, two senators and two deputies are elected for each senatorial constituency and electoral district. By the end of 2017, this system will be replaced by the well-known D’Hondt method, which entails a significant increase in the number of parliamentarians and the redistribution of seats in the legislative chambers. In this study, we discuss the problem of centralism and analyze how this redistribution of seats will affect the voting power of the different regions of the country. To measure the hypothetical voting power of each region we use classical power indices of cooperative game theory. The study shows that although the voting power of the regions in the Senate will remain relatively unchanged, the centralization of power in the Metropolitan Region will be increased in the Chamber of Deputies. Finally, we propose a method to obtain a feasible redistributions of seats, which would effectively increase the voting power of the other regions in the Chamber of Deputies._
